# Welcome to My Diary 📖

Hi, I'm Liu Shuangqi, born in 2004,  
studying Geographic Information Science at Jilin University 🎓,  
and soon to be a college graduate.  
My career path is in QA & Development at Meituan 💻.  

I'm fairly introverted, sometimes sentimental 💭, sometimes rational 🤔.  
I open up around familiar people 😄, but feel a bit reserved around strangers 😅.  
I enjoy working out 🏋️‍♂️, reading interesting articles or blogs 📚,  
occasionally diving into some fantasy 🌸, and savoring a good cup of coffee ☕ to enjoy a quiet moment 🌅.

This is where I record my daily life ✍️.  
Like chatting with an old friend 🫂, I jot down little bits of my day.  
Life might seem mundane at times, but it's real 💛.  
I hope that ten years from now, I can flip through these pages and still feel the emotions of today 💌.  

Writing in this diary isn't just about recording events,  
it's a way to talk to myself 🪞.  
Sometimes it's the morning sunlight on my desk 🌞,  
sometimes it's the sweat and heavy breathing after a workout 💦,  
or the comfort of a warm cup of coffee ☕.  

Maybe one day, I'll turn these records into a training set 🤖,  
so that a digital version of “me” 🧬 can continue to exist in the future 🌌.
